# Machine-Learning-Class-Project----Bitcoin-Price-Prediction

The project aims to develop a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model to predict future Bitcoin prices. The project will achieve this by gathering and preprocessing historical Bitcoin price data, building and training an LSTM model, and evaluating the model's performance using various metrics. The LSTM model will be trained using 70% of the data and tested using the remaining 30%. The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared score. The model's predictions will be compared to actual prices to determine its accuracy in predicting Bitcoin prices. The project will provide valuable insights for investors and traders in the cryptocurrency market, allowing them to make informed decisions about buying and selling Bitcoin based on the model's predictions.
