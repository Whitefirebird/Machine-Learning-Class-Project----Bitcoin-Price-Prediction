# Machine-Learning-Class-Project----Bitcoin-Price-Prediction

Initial project proposal

1. What is the problem that you will be investigating? What makes the problem interesting?

I am interested in exploring machine learning techniques to predict the price of Bitcoin using a supervised
learning approach. The prediction of Bitcoin prices is a challenging problem because of the high volatility
of this asset. The cryptocurrency market operates continuously and is highly decentralized, making it
vulnerable to sudden shifts in supply and demand that can result in significant price fluctuations. A
successful model would allow investors to make informed decisions about buying and selling Bitcoin,
thereby increasing their chances of making money.

2. What literature or prior work you will you examine to provide context and background necessary
to understand the problem? Cite at least three relevant papers in the initial submission

To provide the necessary context and background to understand the problem of predicting Bitcoin prices
using machine learning, I plan to examine the following three relevant papers:

• Predicting Crypto Currency Prices Using Machine Learning
• Performance Evaluation and Analysis of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms for Bitcoin
Cryptocurrency Price Forecast
• Predicting cash holdings using supervised

NOTE: A couple of these links came from the RPI library so you may need to log in to view them.

3. How could machine learning be useful to address your problem?

Using supervised learning to predict Bitcoin prices can be useful due to several reasons. First, the
cryptocurrency market is highly complex and changes rapidly, making it difficult for humans to analyze the
vast amounts of data generated by this market. Supervised learning algorithms can process and analyze
this data efficiently and identify patterns and trends that human analysts might miss. Second, supervised
learning models can learn from past data on Bitcoin prices to make predictions about future price
movements. These models can be trained using various features such as historical prices, trading volumes,
and network activity, to identify correlations and relationships that can inform predictions about future
prices. Finally, supervised learning algorithms can improve the accuracy and reliability of these predictions
over time. By continually retraining models on the latest data, they can adapt to changes in market
conditions and improve their predictive power.

By using supervised learning in predicting Bitcoin prices has the potential to improve investment strategies
and risk management in the cryptocurrency market while providing valuable insights into the behavior of
this rapidly changing market.

4. What data will you use?

To predict the price of Bitcoin using supervised learning, I will use historical data on Bitcoin prices. This
data includes Dates, Open Prices, Closing Prices, Daily High Price, Dailly Low Price, Volume, and Ending
Percent Change in price. Downloadable Bitcoin historical data can be found using the following link:

5. What method(s) or algorithm(s) are you proposing?

For my project, I am proposing to use a supervised learning algorithm, specifically a regression algorithm,
such as neural networks, to predict Bitcoin prices.

6. Will you use existing algorithms? Will you modify an existing algorithm? Why and how? How do
you plan to improve or modify such implementations? (It is not necessary to have a complete
understanding at the proposal stage, but you should have a vision how your project will end
successfully).

I plan to download the historical dataset from the website listed above and create a pandas dataframe to
organize the data. Ideally, I would like to use the entire dataset, but I am currently unsure if it will be too
computationally expensive to do so. Using the RNN model, it is recommended that I normalize the data to
prevent some features from dominating the training process. Then, I will split the data into training and
testing datasets, and proceed to train the RNN model using the training dataset. I will evaluate the model's
performance using suitable regression metrics such as r2 score, mean squared error, and absolute error.
After obtaining results, I will tune the hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.

I did find an existing algorithm that uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) to makes predictions in the price of Bitcoin. This can be seen using the following link:
